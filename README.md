# Our Purpose
Griot and Grits is a new take on the West African Griot, the storytelling, singing, poet, historian of the village that was tasked with passing on the history of the village orally.  Our mission is to preserve the history of the black experience one voice at a time using AI and other advanced technologies.  

The project aims to achieve the following objectives:  
+ Create a comprehensive, searchable library of recorded oral and video accounts of the lives of local African Americans.
+ Use AI to highlight key events from the recorded content and associate them with similar events to create a richer story.
+ Generate a geographical representation of the stories to allow individuals to search by location.
+ Recreate a documentary-like view of individual stories by using AI to augment key events with additional relevant background information, photos and videos.
+ Build referencable Family Chapters for individuals to find out more about their unique family history.

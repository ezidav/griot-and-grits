# Metadata Key Events Enrichment
## What  

Search for publicly available information associated with provided metadata, which could be a location, key event or person.

## Why

The additional public information will be used to provide richer context and history to the audio or video.  For example, if a subject talks about Jim Crow laws in the south, public information will be provided to give context regarding what Jim Crow laws were, how it affected African Americans, when this happened, and any accompanying audio, video or pictures.

## Goals

* Search for publicly available information, pictures, video or audio associated with metadata.
* Store the additional information securely.
* Associate the information with the metadata and make it indexable and searchable.
* Allow an admin to confirm the content is appropriate and accurate, or decline it if not.

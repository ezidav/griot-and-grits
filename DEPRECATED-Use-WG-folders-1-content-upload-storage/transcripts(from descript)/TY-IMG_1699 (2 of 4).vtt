00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.320
So again, my name is Ty McDuffie,
founder of Griot and Grits.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.520
Um, I don't have a middle name.

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:17.540
Uh, it is simply Ty or Tyrone McDuffie.

00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:23.129
Um, I was born in, uh, West Islip,
New York, uh, in the county of

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:26.799
Suffolk, um, in 1971 on April 22nd.

00:00:27.549 --> 00:00:30.689
I don't think I was named after
anybody or anything like that.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.370
It was, uh, probably because, you know,
um, there were songs like float on

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.250
where people would be like, my name is
Larry, you know, and that kind of thing.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.150
I think my mom just kind of was
like, Hey, Tyrone is a popular name.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.150
You know, in the seventies,
let me give them that one.

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:50.420
Um, I don't have any nicknames
that I, that I was given.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.640
I kind of tried several times to give myself
nicknames, um, that didn't really stick.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.440
That never, that never works when
you give yourself your own nickname.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.479
I wanted to be called at one time, bazooka Joe.

00:01:02.025 --> 00:01:03.875
Uh, from the old bubble gum wrappers.

00:01:04.285 --> 00:01:06.735
Um, I tried to be called Mac at one time.

00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:08.685
That wasn't, that didn't work, you know.

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:11.325
So, I don't have any kind of nicknames at all.

00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:14.965
Um, so, back to my parents.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:19.044
Um, it's kind of complicated, but I'll
try to make it as simple as I can.

00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:22.415
Um, my mother, her name was Josephine McDuffie.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:27.735
Um, she was born in Ivanhoe, North Carolina.

00:01:28.265 --> 00:01:35.250
Um, she was raised by Um, I think her
grandmother, I, I don't know, my, my siblings

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.570
might know a lot more, they will know a
lot more than that, about that than I do.

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:46.880
Um, and my father's name, which is the
complicated part, is, uh, was Perry James Love.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.740
Um, they weren't married when I was
born and in fact he actually had,

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.460
he was married to someone else.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.210
Um, and that's why I say it was kind of
complicated, so much so that I almost, because

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.140
I didn't even know he was my father until.

00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:02.155
Um, I was well into high school.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:06.395
Um, he would come around and visit
at the house sometimes, but I, I, I

00:02:06.395 --> 00:02:08.914
didn't know his relationship to me.

00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:12.445
I just thought it was, you know, one of
the, my mom's friends or something that

00:02:12.445 --> 00:02:13.925
came over to visit every now and then.

00:02:14.645 --> 00:02:21.565
Um, so yeah, um, it, it's,
it's kind of just, just weird.

00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:27.255
I grew up a lot of my, spent a lot of my
life really kind of trying to compensate

00:02:27.265 --> 00:02:28.855
for not having my father around.

00:02:28.855 --> 00:02:34.820
Um, Um, you know, I wrote, I do a lot of writing
and I've written a story about it, about how

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:41.940
I would, you know, uh, make excuses, uh, for
not having my father around, like, um, and I

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.460
didn't know him, you know, I, I kind of painted
him almost like a superhero who's, who's Whose

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.900
only power was like being super busy and so
busy that he couldn't come to anything that I

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.410
was doing So I would always tell people he was
traveling he was doing this he was doing that

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.019
Um, and I remember a particular, uh story, um
in high school once I did find out who he was I

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.110
was in class and it was right before a holiday
break and we were in homeroom You know, they

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.630
would release you from homeroom at like half a
day or whatever and I was sitting behind this.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.170
Uh, this student and he was And for some reason
this day, I felt like I wanted to tell somebody,

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.290
you know, Hey, I, you know, my, this is my dad, my
dad is named this and, and this is what he does.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.119
And so I told this, this person that was
sitting in front of me, I'm not going to mention

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:30.449
his name because even back then he was a lot
bigger than me and he probably still is now.

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.810
So I don't want to incur the wrath of this guy.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.310
Um, but I just, you know, told him, I was like,
Hey, you know, this is my dad or whatever.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.810
Um, or actually, I had told him a couple of
weeks before that, that who my father was,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.910
and he knew who he, who my father was, and
um, I guess he, he didn't live far from him.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.369
So this particular day, sitting in class, I'm
behind him, and he looks around and says, Mr.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.599
Perjane ain't your daddy.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.670
So let me fill you in on
some stuff in the country.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.170
We don't really say, you know, the name,
uh, correct, you know, like it's spelled.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.790
So Perry became per becomes
per and James becomes Jean.

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:13.519
So it was per Jean instead of Perry James.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.710
He says, so Mr.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.810
Per Jean ain't your daddy.

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:21.430
And I mean, I was, I was floored, but you
know, I'm a teenager now and there were girls

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.090
around and all these other kinds of people.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.840
So, I mean, I did whatever I could do.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.030
And, you know, I was like.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.270
You know, I retorted like shut up or something
like that or whatever, but you know, the

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.180
damage had already been done and I mean,
I couldn't, there's nothing I could do.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.560
I couldn't prove it.

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.959
I couldn't do anything.

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:46.309
And so I remember, um, when the class
dismissed, I mean, before the class

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.880
dismissed, I had put my head down on the
desk because by then the tears were starting

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.480
to come and I couldn't be seen crying.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.390
So I literally sat there with my head down
on the desk until everybody cleared out to go

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.620
catch the buses and I just missed my bus home.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.120
Um, so it's complicated and I think it,
uh, it has affected me throughout life.

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.689
Um, it's given me, you know, like
abandonment issues and, uh, what they

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:12.949
call a people, people pleaser mentality.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.529
Cause I'm always trying to
find ways to make people stay.

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:19.039
Um, so yeah, that was.

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:21.969
Kind of the situation I was brought up in.

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:25.519
Um, I don't know how they met.

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:32.884
I don't know Anything about their relationship
before I was born Uh, don't even know much

00:05:32.884 --> 00:05:36.994
about it from after I was born, like I said,
he would just come over every now and then

00:05:36.994 --> 00:05:42.414
and he would bring me like candy and sodas
and I remember sometimes he'd bring over a

00:05:42.424 --> 00:05:46.364
big container of coins and he would let me
just stick my hand in it and bring out as much

00:05:46.364 --> 00:05:48.114
as I could and I could keep whatever I had.

00:05:48.884 --> 00:05:52.519
Um, he passed away a few years ago.

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:56.329
I'm not sure what year anymore.

00:05:56.329 --> 00:05:58.999
I don't remember, but there's an
interesting story about that as well.

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:04.089
Um, I grew up really, really hating
him, uh, for most of my life.

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:08.019
Well, once I found out who he was,
well, before I found out who he was, I

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:11.479
hated the person, whoever that might be,
that was my father for not being there.

00:06:11.859 --> 00:06:16.559
But then when I learned who he was, I hated
him even more for choosing not to be there

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:21.339
and choosing to be with his other family
over us and choosing his other kids over me.

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:27.804
Um, And so one of the things I used to say,
and I'm not proud of this at by any stretch

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:31.504
of the imagination, but one of the things I
would always say was I couldn't wait till he

00:06:31.504 --> 00:06:33.934
died so I could go and just dance on his grave.

00:06:34.074 --> 00:06:35.584
That's literally what I would say.

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:42.629
Um, so we fast forward a bit to he was
on his deathbed, literal deathbed, in

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:44.619
a hospital in Burgaw, North Carolina.

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:54.959
And he had had a stroke, um, and so he
couldn't move the left side of his body.

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:56.419
He couldn't, he couldn't move at all.

00:06:56.429 --> 00:06:57.219
He couldn't talk.

00:06:57.269 --> 00:07:03.029
He was like, or he was pretty nonverbal
at the time, but he was aware of things.

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:06.589
He could look around and you could tell, you could
look in his eyes and tell something was there.

00:07:08.494 --> 00:07:14.094
Me, being the person that was trying to win
his favor and even in these last moments was,

00:07:14.254 --> 00:07:19.664
I was in the room wiping his head, you know,
with a wet towel, just trying to keep him cool

00:07:19.664 --> 00:07:25.434
and, you know, trying to show him that I was
there and it was me, uh, my brother Ricky,

00:07:26.194 --> 00:07:33.044
um, a couple of other siblings, I think, and,
you know, we were just standing around and

00:07:33.054 --> 00:07:35.464
I remember just starting to lose it, right?

00:07:35.524 --> 00:07:36.514
The tears were coming.

00:07:36.514 --> 00:07:37.574
I was wiping his head.

00:07:37.574 --> 00:07:42.794
I was just Thinking over my life
without him and my brother, Ricky, he

00:07:42.794 --> 00:07:45.794
says, Hey, you know, everybody, let's
give him a minute, you know, in here.

00:07:45.794 --> 00:07:50.784
So everybody walked out and so
they walk out and I'm in there.

00:07:50.784 --> 00:07:55.964
It's just me and my, my father and
I'm just wiping his head and I'm

00:07:55.984 --> 00:07:57.514
trying to talk to him a little bit.

00:07:57.524 --> 00:08:00.284
And, you know, I didn't know what to say.

00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:02.774
Nobody knows really what to
say in that, that period.

00:08:02.774 --> 00:08:06.184
I was telling him, I know I told him
I love him and those kinds of things.

00:08:06.749 --> 00:08:11.219
And I remember he couldn't move his left
side, but he, you know, I was leaning

00:08:11.219 --> 00:08:14.429
down kind of whispering to him and he
reached over and he kind of grabbed my

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:17.359
arm and he pulled at me a little bit.

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:21.739
Nothing really forceful, but you could
tell he was trying to pull me near him.

00:08:22.329 --> 00:08:29.079
And so I lean all the way down to him and I
could, I could see his lips trying to move or

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:31.179
moving a little bit from the corner of my eye.

00:08:31.574 --> 00:08:33.264
But nothing really was coming out.

00:08:33.904 --> 00:08:40.584
Um, but at that moment, I chose to believe
that was him, um, asking for my forgiveness.

00:08:41.344 --> 00:08:44.504
And I also chose to give that
forgiveness at that time.

00:08:45.094 --> 00:08:49.234
Um, it, it, I'm not gonna say it didn't,
it doesn't still sting that I didn't

00:08:49.234 --> 00:08:53.104
have a father around and, and, and
those issues that I have because of it.

00:08:53.104 --> 00:08:58.804
But, you know, I feel as though we, we
made, um, a positive stride at that moment.

00:08:59.714 --> 00:09:09.384
Um, my mother, who was, My absolute
biggest supporter, um, my first love, um,

00:09:09.404 --> 00:09:15.084
she passed away a few years ago and it's
still really super, super hard on me.

00:09:15.604 --> 00:09:23.404
Um, she was always the one, um, that was
like, just had my back in all situations.

00:09:23.624 --> 00:09:28.784
It was a little, it wasn't like the real,
my mom wasn't an overly sensitive kind of

00:09:28.784 --> 00:09:33.554
person, wasn't a touchy, feely, huggy type
person, but she showed love by doing things.

00:09:33.934 --> 00:09:38.864
She showed love by making the money and paying
the bills and cooking dinner, uh, before she had

00:09:38.864 --> 00:09:45.594
to go to bed because she worked, uh, at midnight,
um, at the, uh, textile place in our town.

00:09:46.344 --> 00:09:51.104
Um, but you know, we all knew, um,
how she felt about us and everything.

00:09:51.104 --> 00:09:53.174
And she was, she was a character, man.

00:09:53.174 --> 00:09:57.064
I remember one day she came out dressed
for church, dressed to the nines.

00:09:57.434 --> 00:10:01.869
And she says, Well, I'm sure glad it
ain't fox season because those hunters

00:10:01.869 --> 00:10:08.319
will be after me and that's the kind of
stuff she would always say but I think if

00:10:10.699 --> 00:10:12.649
You know, that's one of the funny stories.

00:10:12.649 --> 00:10:16.449
I mean there another funny kind of story
is I remember for years She had this

00:10:16.459 --> 00:10:19.004
old I can't remember what kind of car.

00:10:19.004 --> 00:10:24.954
I think it was like a some kind of old Buick from
the 70s or 80s, early 80s or something like that.

00:10:24.954 --> 00:10:26.064
It was a used Buick.

00:10:26.364 --> 00:10:27.424
It had to be from the 70s.

00:10:27.424 --> 00:10:30.984
And the reason I know it was from the 70s is
because it had an eight track and she would

00:10:30.984 --> 00:10:33.204
play this eight track tape all the time.

00:10:33.204 --> 00:10:36.615
And I remember hearing her coming
from down the road and it was that

00:10:36.615 --> 00:10:39.754
song war, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.

00:10:39.755 --> 00:10:43.015
And she would just play that thing and it
would be loud and she'd pull up in the yard.

00:10:43.015 --> 00:10:45.905
So that's one of the many
funny stories I have of her.

00:10:47.075 --> 00:10:51.625
There's a load more, but I'm just not gonna, you
know, bore you guys to death with all of those.

00:10:52.905 --> 00:10:57.824
I think if there was one thing I could
go back and tell them each about my

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:01.975
life, this is what those things would be.

00:11:03.815 --> 00:11:06.734
For my father, I'd want him
to know that I forgive him.

00:11:07.144 --> 00:11:08.925
I forgave him a long time ago.

00:11:09.445 --> 00:11:15.244
And I've come to understand that being
an adult doesn't mean that you make the

00:11:15.245 --> 00:11:17.015
right decisions or the best decisions.

00:11:17.555 --> 00:11:18.955
It just means that you're older.

00:11:19.235 --> 00:11:21.925
And you're fumbling your way through
life just like everybody else.

00:11:22.435 --> 00:11:29.744
And I understand that he made a decision
to maintain his family, um, over, uh,

00:11:30.055 --> 00:11:32.044
bringing me fully into the picture.

00:11:32.385 --> 00:11:39.905
Um, I think I kind of got leaked into the picture
a little later in life, um, but I'm still, uh,

00:11:40.105 --> 00:11:45.615
you know, thankful, um, for him giving me life.

00:11:46.035 --> 00:11:50.565
And I'm, you know, I'm forgiving of
what happened and all those things.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.260
And I made it out okay.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.150
You know, I have a few issues,
but I made it out okay.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.180
Nobody makes it through life without scars.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:58.720
It just doesn't happen.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.900
So, I would like to tell him that I'm okay.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.670
And with my mother, more than anything,
I'd like to tell her thank you.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.129
Um, for all those times
when, you know, we were poor.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.850
We were poor, poor.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.600
And I remember her going to bed.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:21.330
She would make us dinner sometimes of like, Rice
with a can of stewed tomatoes stirred in it with

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:23.060
a little bit of butter, because that's all we had.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:30.720
And, you know, I want to tell her, and I
remember her, she would give me her food

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:34.760
sometimes when I was still hungry, and I know
now, looking back, that she was hungry too.

00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:38.969
And I'm thankful for those sacrifices, Mama.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:44.810
I'm thankful for, you know, you sucking
up your pride whenever, back in the day,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.590
um, the, what did we used to call them?

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.380
Not the, yeah, the welfare people.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:53.370
Would come by the house and they would make
sure that there was no able bodied male in the

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.220
house That could be working and bringing in
money and stuff And I remember thinking mama

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:00.260
I would tell them off if they were telling
me what I couldn't do in my house and what I

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:06.490
couldn't You know couldn't have in my house
And she never did you know because she knew

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:08.789
that we needed those things to survive mama.

00:13:08.789 --> 00:13:14.370
I'm thankful for You know you going out
and getting free vegetables wherever you

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:19.499
could and whenever you could now I hated
Absolutely hated shelling peas half the

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:24.710
day Shucking corn the other half of the
day, but I sure did appreciate those meals.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:30.000
And if I didn't tell you enough, mama, I
appreciate your strength, your resilience,

00:13:30.029 --> 00:13:34.269
your willingness, your intelligence,
my mother wasn't highly educated,

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.619
but she was extremely intelligent.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.240
And I would tell them that mama, I'm okay.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:39.669
And you did your job.

00:13:40.329 --> 00:13:41.159
You helped me.

00:13:41.835 --> 00:13:45.885
Off to a better start and you were even
given at the end of your life and I'm

00:13:45.885 --> 00:13:50.215
grateful for it Um brothers and sisters.

00:13:50.215 --> 00:13:50.605
Yes.

00:13:50.635 --> 00:13:51.565
There's a bunch of us.

00:13:51.675 --> 00:13:58.575
Um, there were eight of us Um, and i'll try
to say their names in oldest to youngest.

00:13:58.945 --> 00:14:02.164
I don't know birthdays or I don't
remember birthdays So forgive me.

00:14:02.495 --> 00:14:07.205
The mcduffie Uh, then it was Sidney, a.

00:14:07.215 --> 00:14:07.425
k.

00:14:07.425 --> 00:14:07.635
a.

00:14:07.645 --> 00:14:09.705
Foot McDuffie, I mean Sutton.

00:14:10.295 --> 00:14:14.095
Um, and he's the one that
passed away a few years back.

00:14:14.615 --> 00:14:19.195
Um, there was, or is, my sister Joanne Bushra.

00:14:19.475 --> 00:14:20.955
She lives in Florida.

00:14:21.065 --> 00:14:23.215
Oh, and by the way, Nathan lives in New York.

00:14:23.805 --> 00:14:26.675
Um, then it's my sister Wanda Sutton.

00:14:26.725 --> 00:14:28.555
She lives in Wallace, North Carolina.

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:32.115
Um, my brother Bobby Sutton.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:34.310
He lives in Wallace, North Carolina.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.560
Dale Sutton, I believe is Leland, North Carolina.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:45.380
And then is my little sister
Charmaine, um, Briggs.

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.260
She lives in Raleigh, North Carolina.

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:54.179
Um, if I was to think of their, you know,
kind of describe them and start with a little

00:14:54.179 --> 00:14:56.079
bit of physical characteristics, I guess.

00:14:56.909 --> 00:14:58.609
Uh, Nathan, we call him Monk.

00:14:59.075 --> 00:15:03.105
I always thought he was like monk is
kind of he's not super tall, but he's

00:15:03.105 --> 00:15:04.815
not super short, but he's very stout.

00:15:04.825 --> 00:15:05.275
He does.

00:15:05.285 --> 00:15:09.285
He's been doing like construction
contracting work most of his life.

00:15:09.644 --> 00:15:15.705
And if I was to describe him, like his personality
monk is probably the most patient of all of us.

00:15:16.095 --> 00:15:18.864
I remember one time him taking me fishing.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:26.350
And one of my earliest memories of going
fishing and, you know, not, not the

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:28.510
earliest, but one of them, I love fishing.

00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:34.959
He would, um, I thrown the line out or something,
somehow it got all messed up and jumbled up.

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:38.149
And I was like, Hey, you know, cut it.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:38.969
Can you cut this?

00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.590
Can you cut this?

00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:40.390
I want to keep fishing.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:46.440
He made me sit there for quite a while and
actually work the knots out of the line.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.790
And he could have let me, you know, cut it.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.690
Um, or he could have cut it, but I think what
he was doing was showing me, you know, the

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:57.390
patience to sit still and work through problems.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:03.039
So Nathan's big thing, I think, if I would
describe him, his personality, his patient,

00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:09.969
he's not a man of many words, actually, none
of my brothers, except Sidney, talked a lot.

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:16.270
Um, and so when, when Nate would say something,
um, you know, it carried a lot of weight, um,

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.830
with it, cause he didn't, he just didn't say much.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:22.110
Um, Sidney.

00:16:25.145 --> 00:16:27.795
Sidney Foote, his nickname was Foote.

00:16:27.885 --> 00:16:30.805
I think it comes from the fact
that he always was a karate person.

00:16:30.805 --> 00:16:31.805
He loved karate music.

00:16:31.805 --> 00:16:34.425
He loved fighting, those kinds of things.

00:16:34.805 --> 00:16:36.054
Funny story about him.

00:16:36.734 --> 00:16:44.164
Um, he, um, one time I had, I had blown
out the motor in my, uh, Hyundai Sonata

00:16:44.555 --> 00:16:48.335
trying to like race my brother on the
street in front of my mom's house.

00:16:48.345 --> 00:16:50.505
And, uh, I guess I hadn't had the oil changed.

00:16:50.505 --> 00:16:51.265
And so it done.

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.650
Some damage to stuff.

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:56.900
So we had taken it to a neighborhood
mechanic guy, um, to fix it.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:01.309
He was a family friend, but he had
been taking like forever to, to fix it.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.720
And I was without a car.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.240
So I was bumming rides here and there, all
that kind of stuff to get to him from work.

00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:10.390
Plus Wallace is about an hour and
some change from where I live.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.824
So.

00:17:11.115 --> 00:17:13.245
You know, I couldn't get down
there to check on it or anything.

00:17:13.555 --> 00:17:19.155
Now, at this time foot was on, he had gotten, I
think it was COPD when he was in the military,

00:17:19.155 --> 00:17:24.614
so he was on like an inhaler and stuff, but
remember I said he loved to fight and he

00:17:24.615 --> 00:17:27.695
would tell me, man, I'll go down there and
I'll talk to him anytime, man, all I gotta

00:17:27.695 --> 00:17:29.485
do is take a hit of my inhaler and I'm on it.

00:17:30.004 --> 00:17:33.935
And so, you know, of course I would talk him down
from it, but he would go down there and talk.

00:17:33.935 --> 00:17:36.525
He wouldn't never do any of those
kinds of threatening things, but.

00:17:38.005 --> 00:17:42.065
You know, he was always all about
family and always wanting to take care

00:17:42.065 --> 00:17:44.155
of everybody and be their protector.

00:17:44.455 --> 00:17:51.925
So I would say for the most part, um, Sidney
aka Foot was, he was a protector of family.

00:17:52.215 --> 00:17:54.104
You know, it was always family first with him.

00:17:54.104 --> 00:17:58.114
If we went to Wallace, he'd want to sit
down and play Scrabble, which he'd never win

00:17:58.115 --> 00:18:01.845
and he would cheat at, but he always just
wanted to have that family time together.

00:18:02.755 --> 00:18:04.355
Um, Joanne.

00:18:05.275 --> 00:18:09.395
Joanne is like the mother, the
second mother of the family.

00:18:09.745 --> 00:18:14.635
Um, and I always tell Joanne if she laughs in
front of people and they don't feel uplifted

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:16.355
or feel better, then they don't have a soul.

00:18:16.655 --> 00:18:21.194
Because Joanne is like, she's,
she's the greatest person.

00:18:21.235 --> 00:18:25.455
I mean, just, she's feisty as all
get out, but she's just the sweetest,

00:18:25.925 --> 00:18:27.615
happiest person you ever meet.

00:18:27.965 --> 00:18:30.265
She has the most positive outlook on things.

00:18:30.635 --> 00:18:32.995
Um, if you're ever feeling down, call Joanne.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.875
So I think that would describe her.

00:18:36.075 --> 00:18:37.215
And she's very small.

00:18:37.215 --> 00:18:42.575
Joanne is like maybe five, two,
five, three, somewhere in like that.

00:18:42.825 --> 00:18:44.794
She'll get so mad at this,
but I'm gonna tell it anyway.

00:18:44.805 --> 00:18:47.845
And one year she was mad because her
job had asked, it was Christmas time

00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:51.925
and they literally asked her to dress
up like an elf and she refused to do it.

00:18:52.274 --> 00:18:55.795
So, um, she kind of got upset
about that, but that's Joanne.

00:18:56.295 --> 00:19:01.105
Um, Wanda, Wanda is, is awesome as well.

00:19:01.385 --> 00:19:02.505
Wanda is different.

00:19:02.875 --> 00:19:05.365
Wanda is one of those, she's a free spirit.

00:19:05.485 --> 00:19:10.515
If one, we would, I remember waking up some days
in Wallace and everybody's like, where's Wanda?

00:19:10.525 --> 00:19:11.035
I don't know.

00:19:11.045 --> 00:19:11.635
Where's Wanda?

00:19:11.635 --> 00:19:12.185
I don't know.

00:19:12.645 --> 00:19:14.745
And we get a call from my
aunt's house in New York.

00:19:14.755 --> 00:19:15.475
Wanda's here.

00:19:16.255 --> 00:19:21.044
We're like, we didn't even know she was, she was
leaving, but that's how Wanda always has been.

00:19:21.044 --> 00:19:24.215
She's just been, you know, one of those
people, if she gets something in her

00:19:24.215 --> 00:19:26.285
mind and she's going to do, she does it.

00:19:26.695 --> 00:19:28.785
And there's no talking her down from it.

00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:34.035
Um, so now let's talk about Bobby.

00:19:35.065 --> 00:19:38.895
Bobby is, and I tell people this all the
time, and I hope I don't upset my other

00:19:38.895 --> 00:19:40.995
siblings, but Bobby has always been my hero.

00:19:42.094 --> 00:19:49.154
Um, Bobby's been the person that,
as far as strength goes, strength

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:53.804
of a person that I aspire to be.

00:19:54.644 --> 00:19:58.144
Um, Bobby gets, he would get knocked down a lot.

00:19:58.174 --> 00:20:02.144
He's gotten locked, knocked down a
lot in his life, but he always gets

00:20:02.144 --> 00:20:04.794
back up every single time swinging.

00:20:05.329 --> 00:20:11.589
And, you know, um, he's just, he's just
been, uh, he's a force, he's a force.

00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:15.159
He makes things, makes them work.

00:20:15.679 --> 00:20:16.299
You know what I mean?

00:20:16.309 --> 00:20:22.659
And he's the most, like, I would say the most
dependable out of all the siblings here, at least.

00:20:23.209 --> 00:20:26.329
Um, if you need something fixed, call Bobby.

00:20:26.339 --> 00:20:28.369
If your car breaks down, call Bobby.

00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:33.969
If you need, uh, you know, a floor
put in your attic, call Bobby.

00:20:34.269 --> 00:20:35.269
I did all those things.

00:20:35.309 --> 00:20:38.179
I mean, I've done all those things
and he's always come through for me.

00:20:38.179 --> 00:20:41.479
And so again, Bobby's my absolute hero, man.

00:20:41.479 --> 00:20:43.009
And if you're watching this dude, I love you.

00:20:43.009 --> 00:20:45.279
And I thank you, Dale.

00:20:46.459 --> 00:20:52.369
Dale is the hardest worker
I've ever seen in my life.

00:20:53.019 --> 00:20:54.789
Uh, Oh, but let me back up to Bobby.

00:20:55.309 --> 00:20:56.919
I forgot to tell a story about Bobby.

00:20:57.349 --> 00:21:00.579
One of my fondest, and it's not
even a memory of mine anymore.

00:21:00.579 --> 00:21:04.739
I have little bits and pieces of it is
when we first moved to North Carolina.

00:21:05.209 --> 00:21:07.529
Um, I didn't know how to ride a bike.

00:21:07.529 --> 00:21:13.449
So Bobby was giving me a ride on his
10 speed and I was on the handlebars.

00:21:13.449 --> 00:21:17.319
You know how we used to do just riding
on the handlebars and somehow some way my

00:21:17.629 --> 00:21:22.859
foot got stuck in the spokes of the front
tire and the whole bike just flipped over.

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:28.719
And when Bobby tells the story now, he
always says that, you know, he grabbed

00:21:28.719 --> 00:21:31.899
me to keep me from getting getting
hurt because he knew mama would be mad.

00:21:32.399 --> 00:21:37.269
But he always says, well, the minute you
got up, you were like my shoe, my shoe.

00:21:37.269 --> 00:21:39.529
And he's like, well, I was all
scratched up and everything.

00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:40.949
And all you could worry about was your shoe.

00:21:41.499 --> 00:21:45.139
So that's just one of many
funny stories about Bobby.

00:21:47.019 --> 00:21:50.729
Now, Dale, Dale, hardest worker I've ever seen.

00:21:51.229 --> 00:21:53.899
Um, and Dale's, he's not a, not a big guy.

00:21:53.899 --> 00:21:54.929
Never has been a big guy.

00:21:54.979 --> 00:21:57.979
And I think he's one of the happy,
you know, he was always happy.

00:21:57.979 --> 00:22:00.139
They used to call him a smiley in high school.

00:22:00.159 --> 00:22:01.889
He had the big Afro and everything.

00:22:01.889 --> 00:22:05.739
I have a picture of him out in the
front yard, picking out his Afro.

00:22:06.329 --> 00:22:10.829
Um, but Dale's another, another positive, um, one.

00:22:10.839 --> 00:22:15.709
They all, all of my siblings kind of
look at life, um, in a positive lens.

00:22:16.309 --> 00:22:17.319
Through a positive lens.

00:22:17.839 --> 00:22:23.039
Um, so, but yeah, funny story about Dale, man,
is if you ever need your stuff moved, if you're

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:29.549
moving from one house to another, call Dale, your
stuff ain't going to get there unscathed, but

00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:34.299
it's going to get there because Dale does not
waste time when he shows up to work, he's going

00:22:34.299 --> 00:22:39.019
to work and he's going to get stuff done and
he's going to get stuff moved and your stuff's

00:22:39.019 --> 00:22:44.509
going to be packed like crazy in a truck, but
it's going to get there and it's going to get

00:22:44.519 --> 00:22:47.349
there with dings and scratches and marks on it.

00:22:47.359 --> 00:22:47.569
But.

00:22:48.009 --> 00:22:51.819
You know, it's not because of lack
of his trying, you know, it was just

00:22:51.959 --> 00:22:54.759
how he is, how he works baby sister.

00:22:54.759 --> 00:23:02.199
Charmaine Charmaine is a
beautiful, feisty little spirit.

00:23:02.809 --> 00:23:07.859
Um, I mean, and I tell her all the time, I
still think of her, like, in this picture I

00:23:07.859 --> 00:23:11.049
got of her when she was a little girl, she
couldn't have been any older than, like, 3.

00:23:11.369 --> 00:23:12.789
She just had a cookie in her mouth.

00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:18.629
And that's how I still see her, even
though she's Much older than that now, um,

00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:20.539
you know, with our own kids and things.

00:23:20.959 --> 00:23:25.889
Um, but Charmaine is just like, you
know, she was always mama's baby.

00:23:25.889 --> 00:23:30.459
You know, the last one she, you know, the rest
of us, like I'll tell about me, for instance, I

00:23:30.459 --> 00:23:35.539
had to work in the tobacco fields and blueberry
fields and cucumber fields and pepper fields

00:23:35.539 --> 00:23:40.619
and watermelon fields to make money, you
know, to buy clothes and things, not Charmaine

00:23:40.969 --> 00:23:44.069
never had to do any of that, but Charmaine is.

00:23:44.459 --> 00:23:46.329
She's a survivor, you know.

00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:52.169
Uh, she's been through some things that have
made her personality the way it is, but you know,

00:23:52.209 --> 00:23:57.849
underneath that hard fake exterior of hers, she's
a really soft hearted, caring, loving person.

00:23:59.269 --> 00:24:08.279
Um, I would think, well, we all know who mama's
favorite one was, um, mama's favorite was Bobby.

00:24:09.509 --> 00:24:13.149
And, you know, and I don't, I don't
know why Bobby always got in trouble.

00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:14.949
Bobby always did crazy stuff.

00:24:14.969 --> 00:24:16.419
He was Bobby was like.

00:24:16.819 --> 00:24:21.309
the wild man of the family, but we
all know Bobby was the favorite.

00:24:21.779 --> 00:24:25.729
I would say, well, it's a toss up between
Bobby and Joanne, because Joanne was like the

00:24:25.729 --> 00:24:34.339
second mama, but Bobby was like, you know, just
that roguish boyish kind of, uh, young man.

00:24:34.749 --> 00:24:40.029
So we all think we agree that, you
know, Bobby was mama's favorite.

00:24:41.019 --> 00:24:45.869
Um, I don't know if we ever did anything crazy
together because they were so much older than me.

00:24:46.304 --> 00:24:51.924
Um, me and Charmaine might have had a few
stories, um, you know, like for instance we

00:24:51.924 --> 00:24:57.064
would trek around in the woods, me and some
of my friends from my youth would trek around

00:24:57.064 --> 00:25:00.034
through the woods, you know, because we were
in the country, that's what country people do.

00:25:00.494 --> 00:25:05.084
And we'd have an axe and we'd cut down trees
and stuff and there would be this little snotty

00:25:05.104 --> 00:25:07.814
nosed little girl right behind us all the time.

00:25:08.194 --> 00:25:12.484
And I even remember one time we cut down
this big tree because we were always

00:25:12.484 --> 00:25:14.184
talking about building forts and stuff.

00:25:14.559 --> 00:25:18.859
I don't think mama, my mama, or their mother knew
what we were actually doing out there cutting

00:25:18.869 --> 00:25:24.769
down trees, um, and they never questioned us,
never saw us take the axe, so I don't know.

00:25:25.079 --> 00:25:29.129
But anyway, cut down this one particular tree
and Charmaine was there, little snot nosed

00:25:29.159 --> 00:25:32.859
little girl, and the tree started falling towards
her and we were screaming, get out of the way!

00:25:33.099 --> 00:25:33.629
Move!

00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:38.869
She didn't move, and the tree hit, was like,
quack, and it stopped like just a few feet over

00:25:38.869 --> 00:25:41.299
her head, it got caught up in vines and stuff, so.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:41.369
So.

00:25:41.709 --> 00:25:47.529
Um, not only was Charmaine like, you know, strong
willed or whatever, she was also very, very lucky.

00:25:48.119 --> 00:25:51.759
Um, so there wasn't a lot of crazy stuff
that I can recall with my siblings.

00:25:52.819 --> 00:25:56.019
Um, have I been married before?

00:25:56.509 --> 00:25:58.179
Yes, I've been married one time.

00:25:58.919 --> 00:26:02.489
Um, I married, uh, Sharon Burwell McDuffie.

00:26:03.014 --> 00:26:12.334
Um, she was born in Durham
in 1968, February 18th, 1968.

00:26:13.514 --> 00:26:18.964
Um, we actually met in, believe it or not,
right before basic training for the Air Force.

00:26:18.964 --> 00:26:22.614
We were at the MEPS station where they do all
the medical testing and all that kind of stuff.

00:26:23.154 --> 00:26:24.154
Um, we met there.

00:26:24.574 --> 00:26:28.014
Um, and then we got stationed
at, for basic training.

00:26:28.244 --> 00:26:31.284
She was in one flight and I
was in the brother flight.

00:26:31.284 --> 00:26:32.914
So we actually were right across the hall.

00:26:33.654 --> 00:26:37.404
Um, and so we, we saw them,
you know, all the time.

00:26:37.684 --> 00:26:42.274
And the funny story about that is, um,
she was actually trying to hook me up

00:26:42.284 --> 00:26:44.604
with some of her friends in her flight.

00:26:44.604 --> 00:26:47.674
A few of them like me, you know,
because my boy is good looks.

00:26:48.844 --> 00:26:50.844
Um, a few of the friends liked me.

00:26:51.214 --> 00:26:55.204
Um, and so we were in church one
Sunday and in full military gear.

00:26:55.559 --> 00:26:59.209
And you know, you're not supposed to be talking
with the sister flight and all that kind of stuff.

00:26:59.209 --> 00:27:01.919
So apparently we figured out
some kind of way to pass notes.

00:27:02.259 --> 00:27:06.619
And so she had passed me a note
saying, okay, uh, these girls like

00:27:06.629 --> 00:27:08.319
you, which one do you want to talk to?

00:27:08.639 --> 00:27:09.419
Pass me the note.

00:27:10.129 --> 00:27:12.359
I did the smooth thing.

00:27:13.069 --> 00:27:17.169
I wrote you slid the note back.

00:27:18.449 --> 00:27:20.929
She did something that was unexpected by it to me.

00:27:21.119 --> 00:27:24.929
She sent me another note back
and she says, I'm not an option.

00:27:27.119 --> 00:27:27.609
Checkmate.

00:27:28.499 --> 00:27:32.649
Or so she thought, you know, um, so
I guess you can see where it went.

00:27:32.659 --> 00:27:37.559
She didn't win that argument, but,
um, yeah, um, that's how we met.

00:27:37.579 --> 00:27:41.819
That's how we, you know, uh, that's
how we built the relationship.

00:27:42.349 --> 00:27:45.059
So I think, what first attracted me to her?

00:27:46.609 --> 00:27:51.589
I think if you're talking about
physically, it was her smile.

00:27:52.299 --> 00:27:56.869
She had these little dimple type things
that she would When she would smile that

00:27:56.869 --> 00:27:58.529
I just thought were the cutest thing ever.

00:27:58.999 --> 00:28:04.189
And I remember when she went to Wallace to
meet my mother for the first time, my friend,

00:28:04.189 --> 00:28:06.889
Chris was over there or he went there.

00:28:07.219 --> 00:28:08.969
And I remember being on the phone with him.

00:28:08.969 --> 00:28:10.069
It's like, look at her smile.

00:28:10.079 --> 00:28:11.759
You see the dimples, check out those dimples, man.

00:28:11.759 --> 00:28:12.329
Ain't that cute?

00:28:12.849 --> 00:28:17.049
So yeah, that was the thing that
attracted to me first, me to her first.

00:28:23.549 --> 00:28:30.139
Um, the question is what made
me fall in love with her?

00:28:32.739 --> 00:28:34.059
That's a, that's a tough one.

00:28:35.059 --> 00:28:38.849
I think overall it was just her personality.

00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:43.489
Um, she was, you know, she was strong but humble.

00:28:44.009 --> 00:28:49.309
Um, and you know, she was beautiful
to me anyway, but you know, she had

00:28:49.309 --> 00:28:51.469
so many of the qualities that I liked.

00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:57.899
Um, I think, so yeah, I would think that
I fell in love with her because of, you

00:28:57.899 --> 00:29:02.519
know, her strength, her vulnerability.

00:29:04.404 --> 00:29:11.464
Yeah, so her career, um, she was,
so we were both in the military.

00:29:11.784 --> 00:29:17.914
She worked in supply, um, which is like, you
know, whenever anybody needed anything, you

00:29:17.914 --> 00:29:21.344
know, ordered around the base, they would go
to supply or put in their order and supply

00:29:21.344 --> 00:29:26.624
would deliver it to them, whether that's
machine parts or folders or what have you.

00:29:27.514 --> 00:29:33.104
Um, my career since we're here
was, well, we'll get to that later.

00:29:33.629 --> 00:29:40.689
Um, her greatest career achievement, I think,
was, um, well, let me back up, actually, because

00:29:40.689 --> 00:29:42.339
I didn't finish talking about her career.

00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:44.829
So she started in the Air Force.

00:29:45.539 --> 00:29:49.609
Um, when we got out, she worked, and I'm going
to get some of these, I might forget some

00:29:49.609 --> 00:29:54.259
of these jobs, and I might not mention or
get them out of order if I do remember them.

00:29:54.629 --> 00:29:59.209
But she worked for this company called Enmarsh,
um, in New Mexico, because that's where we were.

00:29:59.585 --> 00:30:05.175
And she would, uh, take care of mentally
challenged people like at night, um, or during

00:30:05.175 --> 00:30:08.905
the day, whatever the shift would call and do
things like take them shopping, things like that.

00:30:09.355 --> 00:30:15.705
Um, she's worked at a Sam's Club,
uh, like folding clothes and things.

00:30:16.185 --> 00:30:23.525
She's worked at like a, um, a school
or program for like troubled kids.

00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:30.225
Um, and, um, oh, oh, and she was
an adjuster for Allstate, um, a

00:30:30.225 --> 00:30:32.255
vehicle adjuster, insurance adjuster.

00:30:32.775 --> 00:30:36.125
Um, that's the only ones I
can really remember right now.

00:30:36.525 --> 00:30:41.474
Um, as far as an accomplishment in her jobs, I
think she would think or say that her greatest

00:30:41.474 --> 00:30:49.485
accomplishment Um, was winning, uh, some kind of
award, um, in, oh, this is funny, um, while she

00:30:49.485 --> 00:30:55.045
was in the Air Force, um, and it's her greatest
accomplishment, but it's also her, her most hated

00:30:55.045 --> 00:31:01.045
moment because what she won was a flight in like
some kind of plane, a C 130, I think it was,

00:31:01.045 --> 00:31:06.085
like a cargo plane, and you know, those things
aren't smooth rides, so she was talking about how

00:31:06.085 --> 00:31:10.275
she was in the back of it, and the ride was so
rough and so bad, and all she wanted to do was

00:31:10.275 --> 00:31:16.360
get on the ground again, And she was sick from
that flight for like two, three days afterwards.

00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.480
I mean like physically just sick.

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:22.820
And so I think that's, that's, you
know, and that's one of the funny

00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:25.480
stories, um, about her as well.

00:31:26.539 --> 00:31:33.010
Um, growing up, um, did I have any
sense of us being rich or poor?

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:36.360
That's a very interesting,
uh, part of the conversation.

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:44.630
Um, I did have a concept of us being poor,
but it was weird because everybody was.

00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.190
In my neighborhood, everybody was poor.

00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:52.190
Um, so it's like asking a
fish if it knows it's wet.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.449
It doesn't know it's wet until
it gets out of the water.

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:59.119
And it's like, hey, I, I missed
that, that wetness or whatever.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:06.300
Um, or maybe I told that reverse, but either
way, um, I, I, I kinda knew, but it didn't

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:11.450
matter because everybody else was, um, I
remember one of the first times I knew that

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:19.015
we were really poor, um, was that, Mama
had bought me a Washington Redskins jacket,

00:32:19.575 --> 00:32:23.235
um, from a yard sale unbeknownst to me.

00:32:23.795 --> 00:32:24.785
And it was cool.

00:32:24.795 --> 00:32:28.905
It had like the leather sleeves and you
know, it had the, the symbol, the logo

00:32:28.905 --> 00:32:31.454
on the, on the, on the chest over there.

00:32:32.025 --> 00:32:34.825
And, and it was red and gold.

00:32:35.585 --> 00:32:39.175
And I remember wearing it to school one day and
this guy, I'm not going to mention his name.

00:32:39.175 --> 00:32:40.365
He's like, Hey, that's my jacket.

00:32:40.855 --> 00:32:41.335
No, it's not.

00:32:41.335 --> 00:32:42.675
My mama bought me this jacket, man.

00:32:42.675 --> 00:32:43.965
This is my Redskins jacket.

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:46.070
And he's like, let me, let me see it.

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:49.720
And he opened, he took the jacket
off and flip the tag up and you could

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.280
see his name written in the tag.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:56.490
That's one of the, one of the first
times I actually knew or felt poor.

00:32:57.219 --> 00:33:01.549
Um, and when I say poor, I mean,
you know, I, I kind of mentioned

00:33:01.599 --> 00:33:03.449
like what we would eat sometimes.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:07.490
And, you know, I mentioned how we would work
in the fields and all that kind of stuff.

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:12.939
Um, I remember also there were times when
we had to heat our house with the oven.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.630
You know, we didn't have central
heat or anything like that.

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:19.530
We didn't have Like kerosene at some points.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:24.120
Um, sometimes we would have natural gas
and a little gas heater, but if we were

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:28.460
out of gas, we would rent the house or
heat the house with the electric oven.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:33.980
And we would hang sheets at the
doorways of rooms that weren't necessary

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.490
so that we could keep the heat in.

00:33:36.209 --> 00:33:41.890
Um, I also remember, um, when we first
moved to North Carolina, we didn't even

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:46.490
have a bathroom in the house and this is
embarrassing to share, but it is what it is.

00:33:47.105 --> 00:33:54.495
Um, we actually had like a big bucket that
we would use as a bathroom and we would

00:33:54.505 --> 00:33:59.125
take it and down like this dirt road and
dump it in the woods whenever we were done

00:33:59.435 --> 00:34:01.314
until we were able to get a bathroom built.

00:34:01.865 --> 00:34:05.875
Um, because my mother had bought this
house like many, many years before that.

00:34:06.115 --> 00:34:07.895
And it was like a one bedroom house.

00:34:07.905 --> 00:34:11.715
It was just like one room, not one
bedroom, one room in the kitchen.

00:34:12.355 --> 00:34:15.755
Um, and my uncle actually built
on more to it over the years.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:20.070
Um, I also remember we didn't have a, you
know, obviously we didn't have a shower.

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:25.380
So we actually, this was kind of cool when I have
pictures somewhere, there's somewhere somebody

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:31.500
does anyway, on our clothes line, we would hang,
uh, sheets, you know, with the clothes pins.

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:35.810
So we make a little enclosure and
then we would have the water hose

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.080
over it so that we could take showers.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:43.390
But, you know, a lot of times, uh, we would
actually bathe in these little, you know, Tubs.

00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:46.760
Yeah, it was kind of like, you
know, it was, it was rough.

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:50.250
Um, but you know, it is what it is.

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:57.450
Um, I think we, you know, and, and in
reverse we weren't perceived as poor by the

00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:02.509
other people, um, uh, in the neighborhood
because they were in the same boat as us.

00:35:02.959 --> 00:35:08.510
Um, I do remember though, um, there were
friends that, you know, they would have

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:10.500
sometimes even less than we had to eat.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:15.590
Uh, I remember, you know, sometimes their
breakfast would be a pack of these dollar cookies.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:20.310
Um, that you would get from the stores
or that could be their lunch or a can of

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:25.580
like little potted meat or Vienna sausages
or those kind of things, but it was all

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:31.060
normal to us It was all normal and nobody
looked down on anybody else Because of it

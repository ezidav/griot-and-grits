00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:13.690
So, um, my name is Ty McDuffie.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.370
I'm the founder of Griot and Grits.

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:20.040
And I think before I do my own personal interview,
that maybe I'd give you a little background on

00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:22.150
the history of Griot and Grits and what it is.

00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:25.680
So, um, I think it is very beginnings.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.119
Was when I was visiting from, uh, the air force,
I was visiting my mother's house and I was doing

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.940
what most young people do that have just left
home and are coming back to visit or whatever.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.819
I was, I was looking for stuff to steal and
take back with me and I was in my, my sister's

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:47.710
room and I stumbled on a notebook, kind of
just a regular old ratty notebook like this.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.870
And because siblings have no privacy when
I was growing up, um, I looked in it.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.899
And I noticed that there were notes that
she had been writing to her unborn child.

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:02.409
And it was stuff like, you know, Baby, I
understand you're not here yet, and I'm young,

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.839
and I'm scared, and I hope I do a good job.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.760
Those kind of messages to her daughter to
just kind of let her know where her mind

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.750
was at at that time and where her focus was.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.364
So that's the very, very beginning
kernels of Griot and Gritz.

00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:21.675
Then we fast forward many years, uh, to when
my brother Sidney, aka Foot, passed away.

00:01:22.235 --> 00:01:24.045
And I had a dilemma at that point.

00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:27.215
Do I delete his old voicemails from my phone?

00:01:27.215 --> 00:01:31.665
Because everybody always says that you have
to kind of get rid of the past and move on.

00:01:31.675 --> 00:01:34.645
And I had found myself listening
to his voicemails quite often.

00:01:35.155 --> 00:01:39.875
Um, or, you know, or do I, so the other
half of the dilemma was, do I just keep it?

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.370
And, you know, and go back to hear from
him every now and then, and ultimately

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.640
I decided to keep it and I've listened
to him quite a few times since then.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.840
The numbers of times that I
listened to it have decreased a bit.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.809
Um, but I still will pull it out just to
hear my brother's voice every now and then.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.119
Then the third part of it was when
my mother died just a few years ago.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.250
Um, first of all, that was the
hardest experience of my life.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.685
Um, but I was, Talking to
one of her cousins, uh, Ms.

00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:10.345
Hazel and Ms.

00:02:10.345 --> 00:02:14.144
Hazel, you know, as we were talking, she
was, and it had nothing to do with what I had

00:02:14.145 --> 00:02:15.985
been thinking about doing all those years.

00:02:16.374 --> 00:02:16.635
And Ms.

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:20.905
Hazel says, well, Ty, you know, when I'm gone,
all the family history is gone because it's

00:02:20.905 --> 00:02:22.975
just me and my sister left from that generation.

00:02:23.725 --> 00:02:30.670
And so that right there put a, spark in me
to at least preserve my family histories.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.100
So what did I do?

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.370
I did what everybody else does nowadays.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.659
I started a podcast called Real and Grits.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.869
And that podcast was dedicated to,
um, preserving my family history.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.090
And it also acted as a bit of therapy for me
to kind of get the stories out about my family.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.930
And When I initially started, I was like,
okay, well, let me help other people understand

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.500
the importance of saving their history.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.790
Because like, for instance, with just
losing a parent, you don't, it's like,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.660
you don't appreciate how much and how, how
much value and how important to you the

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.800
stories that they used to tell were or are.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.090
So I wanted to introduce people to the concept
of saving their stories as a, as a griot.

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.729
Um, I wanted to introduce people
to the concept of a griot.

00:03:20.245 --> 00:03:25.045
And, you know, and, and empower them
to have griots in their own family.

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:27.165
So we started doing that.

00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:32.705
Um, and my, my ultimate goal was
to create a searchable, what I was

00:03:32.705 --> 00:03:36.274
saying, because I didn't know I'm not
a tech guy, was to create a searchable

00:03:36.275 --> 00:03:38.909
database of oral black family histories.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:47.140
And I mentioned it to a few people, mainly my
friend Gerard, um, who is into AI and he was like,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.560
uh, there's so many ways that we can improve this
and that we can make it more valuable and more

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.419
appealing to so many more people, uh, to help them
understand the importance of saving their history.

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.179
So that's where it came from.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.740
Um, initially from me looking for something to
steal in my mama's house to take back overseas

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.510
with me when I was in the air force to a podcast.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.770
To now, um, partnering with different
people and organizations to try

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.740
to bring this, uh, to fruition.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.500
And there's several reasons why I won't
get into all of that and bore you.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.210
Um, at this point, I guess I'll
just start with, uh, my interview.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.680
Thanks, and I hope I don't bore you to death.
